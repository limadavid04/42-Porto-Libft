1. Clone repo

```
git clone https://github.com/limadavid04/42-Porto-Libft.git
```
2. `cd` into newly cloned directory and Run `make`
```
make
```

3. Now you can compile with your newly `libft.a`

```
cc main.c libft.a
```


##  Makefile Available Targets:
- `make` or `make all` - Makes _libft.a_

- `make bonus` - Makes _libft.a_ with bonus functions

- `make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files

- `make fclean` - Deletes _libft.a_ and all the resulting object files

- `make re` - Deletes everything (object files and _libft.a_) and rebuilds _libft.a_
