# [125/100] libft


__This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.__    



##  Installing and running the project:
1. Clone repo

```
git clone https://github.com/limadavid04/42-Porto-Libft.git
```
2. `cd` into newly cloned directory and Run `make`
```
cd 42-Porto-Libft/src && make
```

3. Now you can compile with your newly `libft.a`

```
cc main.c libft.a
```


##  Makefile Available Targets:
- `make` or `make all` - Makes _libft.a_

- `make bonus` - Makes _libft.a_ with bonus functions

- `make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files

- `make fclean` - Deletes _libft.a_ and all the resulting object files

- `make re` - Deletes everything (object files and _libft.a_) and rebuilds _libft.a_

  

## Tests:

- [x] [Libft War Machine](https://github.com/y3ll0w42/libft-war-machine)

- [x] [Libft Unit Test](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test)

## **Disclaimer**
At 42, the C projects are built following rules that enforce a good coding style. Some of them are:

	- No for, do while, switch, case or goto are allowed
	- No more than 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file
	- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static)
	- No more than 5 variables in 1 function

###### At  [42School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)), every project has specific rules or restrictions, and some of them must be written in accordance with the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette). As a result, parts of the code could be more readable or explicit, and some used technologies could be different.
